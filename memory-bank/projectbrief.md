# Project Brief

This project aims to build robust, production-grade ML pipelines using Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) on Google Cloud Vertex AI.

**Requirements and Goals:**
- Automate end-to-end ML workflow for the Iris dataset using XGBoost and other models
- Cover data ingestion, training, evaluation, model registration, deployment, and inference
- Ensure extensibility, reproducibility, and integration with CI/CD and MLOps best practices
- Enable rapid prototyping and production deployment of ML models
